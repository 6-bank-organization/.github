# SIX Bank Platform - Technical Architecture Design

## Executive Summary

The SIX Bank Platform is an enterprise-grade banking solution built on a cloud-native microservices architecture. This document outlines the comprehensive technical architecture, highlighting the integration of SentiFraud and FX Risk Management systems as core components. The platform is designed for high availability, scalability, security, and compliance with international banking regulations.

## System Architecture Overview

### Architectural Principles

1. **Domain-Driven Design**: Services are organized around business domains rather than technical functions
2. **Event-Driven Architecture**: Asynchronous communication between services using event streams
3. **CQRS Pattern**: Separation of command and query responsibilities for optimal performance
4. **High Availability**: All components designed for redundancy and fault tolerance
5. **Zero Trust Security**: Defense-in-depth approach with the principle of least privilege
6. **Observability First**: Comprehensive monitoring, logging, and tracing built-in from the start
7. **API-First Design**: All functionality exposed through well-defined APIs
